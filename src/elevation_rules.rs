//! Ports the Steam 1.151 firing-arc rules to Steam 1.163 (the `classic` elevation rules).
//!
//! Three independent differences, each patched only when the bytes are what was analysed:
//!
//! 1. `World_RaycastBodies` (`0x140239f30`) adds one to the height level of a candidate body whose
//!    master is missing or of type 7 (free-standing parts: swivel guns, engines, legs). Steam
//!    1.151 does not, so there such a part never blocks a gun on the same level. The `cmovz` that
//!    keeps the plain level for other bodies becomes a plain `mov`.
//! 2. The KAZ module accepts a target when the bearing is below a half-angle: 1.2 rad in 1.151,
//!    pi/4 in 1.163. Two `movss` loads in `Weapon_FlakInterceptScan` are pointed at a 1.2f.
//! 3. The KAZ is blocked when part of its own 360 sectors is covered. 1.151 looked at the rear
//!    34 degrees (sector type 3) with a 50% threshold; the 1.163 data uses type 5 (rear 90
//!    degrees) with 15%. Type 5 is only used by the KAZ, so in `UpdateEngineCovered` the type 5
//!    branch is replaced by "load 0.5 as the threshold, then take the type 3 branch".
